## Why software matters in research

**Data** is part of research output

- Funding agencies often ask for a data management plan

**Software** is part of research output:

- Simulations which generate data
- Control software for instruments
- Post-processing of measurements
- Data processing
- Portals and apps
- Spreadsheets
- Scripts and tools which produce graphs and compute statistics
- Across disciplines
- Machine learning everywhere

Curiosity: Not too many projects consider a software management plan.

## Examples

- Discovery of gravitational waves
  - Tutorials: https://www.gw-openscience.org/tutorials/
  - Software: https://www.gw-openscience.org/software/

- Stanford Activity Inequality study
  - Overview: http://activityinequality.stanford.edu
  - Code is on GitHub: https://github.com/timalthoff/activityinequality

Challenge:
1. Think of a recent major scientific discovery
2. Imagine it without software
3. Imagine it without open source software
