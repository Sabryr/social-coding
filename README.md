# Talk: Social coding and open software

- Slides: [Social coding and open software](http://cicero.xyz/v3/remark/0.14.0/github.com/coderefinery/social-coding/master/talk.md/)
- The following poll can be used by for example [mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/) or Zoom's poll function (for online workshop).
```
## Question 1:Why should I share my scripts/code/data ?

Answer 1:  Easier to find and reproduce (scientific reproducibility)
Answer 2:  More trustworthy: others can verify correctness and find and report bugs
Answer 3:  Enables others to build on top of your code (derivative work, provided the license allows it)
Answer 4:  Others can submit features/improvements
Answer 5:  Others can help fixing bugs
Answer 6:  Many tools and apps are free for open source, so no financial cost for this (GitHub, Travis CI, Appveyor, Read the Docs)
Answer 7:  Good for your CV: you can show what you have built
Answer 8:  Discourages competitors. If others can't build on your work, they will make competing work,
Answer 9:  When publicly shared usually we timestamp or set a version, so it is easier to refer to a spcefic version or when. 


```


```
## Quesion 2: The most concerning thing for me, If I share my software now ( Single Choice)
Answer 1: It will be scooped by someone else
Answer 2: It will expose my "ugly code"
Answer 3: Others may find bugs and mistakes, what if the algorithm is wrong
Answer 4: I will get too many questions, I do not have time for that
Answer 5: Losing control over the direction of the project
Answer 6: Low quality copies will appear
Answer 7: I want be able to sell this later, Someone else will make money from this
Answer 8: It is too early, I am just prototyping, I will write version to distribute later
Answer 9: Worried about licensing and legal matters as they are very complicated'
```

```
## Question 3
Why is software often treated differently from papers?

```

```
## Question 4

Which of these are derivative work?
Answer 1: Download some code from a website and add on to it
Answer 2: Download some code and use a function in your code
Answer 3: Changing the code
Answer 4: Extending the code
Answer 5: Completely rewriting the code
Answer 6: Rewriting the code to a different programming language
Answer 7: Linking to libraries (static or dynamic), plug-ins, and drivers
Answer 8: Clean room design (somebody explains you the code but you have never seen it)
Answer 9: You read a paper, understand algorithm, write own code

```

```
## Exercises
1. What is the StackOverflow license for code you copy and paste?
2. A journal requests that you release your software during publication. You have copied a portion of the code from another package, which you have forgotten. Can you satisfy the journal's request?
3. You want to fix a bug in a project someone else has released, but there is no license. What risks are there?
4. How would you ask someone to add a license?
5. You incorporate MIT, GPL, and BSD3 licensed code into your project. What possible licenses can you pick for your project?
6. You do the same as above but add in another license that looks viral. What possible licenses can you use now?
7. Do licenses apply if you don't distribute your code? Why or why not?
8. Which licenses are most/least attractive for companies with proprietary software?
