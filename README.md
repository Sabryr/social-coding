- Slides: [Social coding and open software](http://cicero.xyz/v3/remark/0.14.0/github.com/coderefinery/social-coding/master/talk.md/)
- The following poll can be used by for example [mentimeter](https://www.mentimeter.com/) or Zoom's poll function (for online workshop).
```
## Question 1:Why should I share my scripts/code/data ?

Answer 1:  Easier to find and reproduce (scientific reproducibility)
Answer 2:  More trustworthy: others can verify correctness and find and report bugs
Answer 3:  Enables others to build on top of your code (derivative work, provided the license allows it)
Answer 4:  Others can submit features/improvements
Answer 5:  Others can help fixing bugs
Answer 6:  Many tools and apps are free for open source, so no financial cost for this (GitHub, Travis CI, Appveyor, Read the Docs)
Answer 7:  Good for your CV: you can show what you have built
Answer 8:  Discourages competitors. If others can't build on your work, they will make competing work,
Answer 9:  When publicly shared usually we timestamp or set a version, so it is easier to refer to a spcefic version or when.

## Quesion 2: The most concerning thing for me, If I share my software now ( Single Choice)

Answer 3: Others may find bugs and mistakes, what if the algorithm is wrong
Answer 4: I will get too many questions, I do not have time for that
Answer 5: Losing control over the direction of the project
Answer 6: Low quality copies will appear
Answer 7: I want be able to sell this later, Someone else will make money from this
Answer 8: It is too early, I am just prototyping, I will write version to distribute later
Answer 9: Worried about licensing and legal matters as they are very complicated'
